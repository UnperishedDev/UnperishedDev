- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @UnperishedDev.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing Minecraft mods + modpacks!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java. I have previously learned HTML5, CSS (not JS though because I got bored with web development). In the future, I may learn C++, C#, or Kotlin.
- If you'd like to see some modding projects I've made, head over to my profile on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/UnperishedDev).
