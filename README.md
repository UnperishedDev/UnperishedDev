- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @UnperishedDev.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing Minecraft mods + modpacks!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java. I have previously learned HTML5, CSS (not JS though because I got bored with web development). In the future, I may continue learning C++.
- If you'd like to see some modpacks I've made (along with possible future mods), head over to my profile on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/UnperishedDev).
